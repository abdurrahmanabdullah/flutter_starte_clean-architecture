# L10n ARB File Helper
#
# Description:
#   This script automates adding new localization strings to a Flutter l10n
#   ARB file (e.g., app_en.arb). It prompts for a string, generates a
#   camelCase key, checks if the key already exists, and appends the new
#   key-value pair and its description to the file.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Save this script as `add_l10n.sh` in the root of your Flutter project.
#   2. Make it executable: `chmod +x add_l10n.sh`
#   3. Run it: `./add_l10n.sh`
#   4. Follow the prompts. Press Ctrl+C to exit.
#

# The path to your primary ARB file.

# --- Functions ---

# Function to display a colored message.
# Arguments:
#   $1: color (red, green, yellow)
#   $2: message string
print_message() {
    # Using standard ANSI escape codes for colors.
